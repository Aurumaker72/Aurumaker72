# About Me

I'm a software developer with a knack for elegant, performant, and user-respecting software.

Most of my OSS contributions focus on interaction and systems design.

# Activity

Here's where I usually toil at least semi-actively, along with what it actually is that I do:

[Mupen64](https://github.com/mupen64/mupen64-rr-lua) as lead maintainer since 2021.

My work here began with minor QoL improvements and grew into iteratively re-architecting the entire project from a catastrophic legacy mess to a somewhat workable, if quirky, codebase.

With the architectural groundwork laid, my focus shifted to feedback-driven major feature development, QoL, and performance. 

[SM64LuaRedux](https://github.com/mupen64/SM64LuaRedux) as lead maintainer since 2023.

This project started as an experiment based on [mkdasher's SM64Lua](https://github.com/mkdasher/SM64Lua) that leveraged [ugui](https://github.com/mupen64/ugui) for GUI.

Initially, I made only minor improvements such as visual changes, QoL improvements, and bugfixes, but upon noticing the dispersed Super Mario 64 TAS Lua tooling ecosystem, I pivoted this project to something resembling an "everything script".

The tools were merged and made accessible, with the added benefit of consistent upstream UI/UX improvements from ugui. 

SM64LuaRedux is now the dominant TASing utility for Super Mario 64 TASing.

[ugui](https://github.com/mupen64/ugui) as lead maintainer since 2023.

This one's pretty banal, it's just an immediate-mode GUI framework for Lua.

It also has a neat renderer abstraction called `BreitbandGraphics`, which provides a backend for rendering in Mupen64 using Direct2D.

[Key2Joy](https://github.com/Key2Joy/Key2Joy) as a somewhat active co-maintainer since 2025

[TAS Comp Bot](https://github.com/bxrru/TAS-Comp-Bot) as a contributor

[Constructorium Games](https://github.com/Constructorium-Games) as a founder
