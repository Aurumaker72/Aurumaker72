# About Me

I'm a software developer with a knack for elegant, performant, and user-respecting software.

Most of my OSS contributions focus on interaction and systems design.

# Activity

Here's where I usually toil at least semi-actively:

[Mupen64](https://github.com/mupen64/mupen64-rr-lua) as lead maintainer since 2021. Note that Mupen64 is the name of an organization *and* an emulator, and I don't maintain all projects under the org.

[SM64LuaRedux](https://github.com/mupen64/SM64LuaRedux) as lead maintainer since 2023

[ugui](https://github.com/mupen64/ugui) as lead maintainer since 2023

[Key2Joy](https://github.com/Key2Joy/Key2Joy) as a somewhat active co-maintainer since 2025

[TAS Comp Bot](https://github.com/bxrru/TAS-Comp-Bot) as a contributor
